# Outlook Voicemail Inbox Traverser
## Background
At North Bristol Trust, colleagues needed a way of scanning 1000+ undelivered emails and collating the email addresses from within the eamil body. This quick python program goes through a shared inbox's emails, uses regular expressions to determine the email address within the body, then copies all found email addresses to the clipboard.

## Installation and Running
Edit `outlook_search_inbox_voicemail.py` with appropriate inbox settings, then run with `python outlook_search_inbox_voicemail.py`.
